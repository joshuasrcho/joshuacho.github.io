      <p>End-to-end systems design, assembly, and deployment of the spacecraft simulator robotic testbed - primarily used 
        for robotics research in control, planning, and fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR). The robotic testbed
        is equipped with compressed air storage tank with air bearing pads, providing 25-30 minutes of floatation on nearly frictionless
        flat epoxy floor. It has 8 thrusters and a reaction wheel required for attitude control and 2D translation of the testbed
        on the floor. COTS hardware selection and multiple custom PCB design/assembly. The newly implemented spacecraft simulator was featured on the cover of Science Robotics Dec. 2024 issue.
